# CircleBoxIntegrations (iOS)

Companion mapping helpers for forwarding CircleBox export envelopes into Sentry/PostHog pipelines.

This module does not import Sentry or PostHog directly. It maps CircleBox envelope data into neutral breadcrumb/event structures you can forward with your existing SDK clients.
